                    Skeletons are the ultimate symbols of mystery and mortality, their bare bones a 
                    reminder of the fragility of life. Though they may seem eerie and lifeless, 
                    they are essential in holding the form of every living creature, quietly supporting 
                    organs and muscles that make movement possible. Despite their spooky appearance, 
                    skeletons don’t have any feelings—they can’t even feel the cold, as they’re just 
                    made of bone and marrow. When people imagine skeletons, they often think of haunted 
                    houses, graveyards, or Halloween decorations, but in truth, they’re always with us, 
                    hidden beneath our skin. In a strange way, skeletons teach us about our own 
                    impermanence and the invisible structures that make us who we are.
