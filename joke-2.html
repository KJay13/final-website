                    Parrots are like the comedians of the bird world, always ready with a joke or a 
                    perfectly timed comment—if only they could figure out how to stop mimicking 
                    your embarrassing moments! They’ll repeat everything you say, even that one 
                    time you accidentally called your boss "Mom" on a Zoom call. And don’t get me 
                    started on their dancing skills—they think every time music plays, 
                    it’s a full-on dance battle, flapping their wings like they're in a rave.
                    Parrots also have zero filter; if you say something strange, they’ll repeat 
                    it for the entire neighborhood to hear, making you wonder if they’re secretly 
                    trying to sabotage your social life. Still, their colorful feathers and endless
                    chatter make them the life of any party—even if you didn’t invite them!
