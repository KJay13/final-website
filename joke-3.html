                    Math can sometimes feel like an impossible puzzle with no clear solution. 
                    The formulas and equations seem to blur together, leaving you stuck on every step. 
                    Itâ€™s as if numbers and symbols have their own language that no one can understand. 
                    Every time you think you've figured it out, another challenge appears, making you question 
                    if you'll ever get it right. Despite the frustration, you keep pushing through, hoping one 
                    day the mysteries of math will finally make sense.

                <p class="joke-sub">Because it had too many problems!</p>
